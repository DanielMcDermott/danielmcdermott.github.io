My thoughts on the "What're you going to do after your PhD" question. 

# Academia or Industry

TBC


I recently read a great column in Nature's Career Column called [what I wish my friends and family knew about my PhD](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00948-7?fbclid=IwAR3eJ_LjO6QU-Xvns_RxrakknDhTMrXSYobimAJihjZ3z0c7GDYeHt4uQGE) by [@kate_samardzic](https://twitter.com/kate_samardzic). The column beautifully puts into words what a vast moajority of PhD students (if not all) experinece, encompassing feelings of imposter syndrome, pressure to publish, the frustation of repeated failures and how we struggle to learn academic resilience. I highly reccomend giving it a read!

Nestled within the column is the advice to friends and family of PhD students:


> Please don’t ask us when we’ll finish and what life after graduate school holds — we might not know yet, and that can be scary. We will tell you when we know. There are a lot of unknowns; instead, tell us you will be there no matter how it turns out.
