title: Finally migrated to GitHub hosting and Jekyll
---

Hello!

For a while now I've had my personal page hosted elsewhere and spent a lot of time fiddling with things to get the pages working as desired. Now, inspried by the effectiveness of Alistair Miles' blog over at http://alimanfoo.github.io/ (and spurred into action by breaking my old site with an update), I have decided to migrate my site and move it to a git repo utilising Jekyll. This especially makes sense now that I have some experience with Git and GitHub from my PhD work.

I intend to use this page for two things: 1. hosting interactive plots that I need to share with colleagues. and 2. Posting occasional blog posts and project updates that others may find interesting and/or useful. 

Watch this space, if interested.
