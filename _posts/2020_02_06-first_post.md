title: Time to make the jump 
---
I have long entertained the idea of having a place to post small pieces of writing or expanded thoughts online but a contradictory combination of laziness and the perceived busyness has been a flimsy but insurmountable barrier until now. 

Recognising the need to improve my writing style, I decided this would be as good a method as any, however, I do apologise in advance to anyone who stumbles across any of my early posts as they may be absolute drivel. 

I plan to post pieces on the time I spend in the field, some interesting graphs I generate as part of my PhD and some short explanations to methodologies I am using. I will try not to stray into far away from areas I have a good understanding of but that could be overly limiting so it is better to just say my writing will come with the caveat that I am not an expert in anything but bluster. Saying that I will also try and point toward the material used to inform my opinion on what I am writing about if you want to look into it further.

A big thanks to Sean Tomlinson for his help in setting this up!
