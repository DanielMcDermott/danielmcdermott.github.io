title: 3D Printing in the Donnelly lab

How useful can 3D printing be in a lab setting? Here's what I've found

I first started off with 3D printing (3DP) a few years ago with the Anet A8 (A8). The A8 cheap build-it-yourself type kit, which does the job of 3D printing objects, albeit not at the greatest resolution straight out of the box. 

I have spent numerous hours upgrading, tweaking, fixing and generally tinkering with the A8 and now have it in a condition where is reliable produces prints analogous to the commercially available and professionally calibrated 3D printers, specifically, the Original Prusa i3 MK2 which the A8 is a clone of.

The most common question I get when people find out I have a 3D printer is either **how much did it cost?** or **what do you use 3DP for?**

To answer the **how much?** question I'm digging deep to remember, but it was roughtly ~£120, and now checking GearBest.com the current price (on 04/10/2018) is £108, so £120 seems about right. 

The **why** question is a bit trickier to directly answer. But generally, I enjoy tinkering with things and building things that I need and 3DP is a great technology for getting very specific, precise and intricate parts for a built project. I had found myself saying **I could 3D print that** long before deciding to buy one. But, the final time was when I was putting my tool wall back together after moving, and deciding that printing dedicated tool holders would etremely useful for oragnising small parts and hand tools. 

So, after searching for a long time, I decided on the A8 (a printer which I do not reccomend buying, for what it's worth), I ordered it, it arrived, I assembled it and began printing. Now, after _many_ hours of print-time, repair-time, upgrading-time,  and finding tiny screws that I dropped onto carpet time, I'm starting to explore more complex areas of 3DP technologies. 

# Printing in the lab

I had seen that some people on Thingiverse.com had designed custom items for specific needs within their lab, ranging from bespoke Eppendorf tube holders, centrifuge tube adapters, rocker trays, etc. However, I never really thought of suggesting we try and use 3DP in our lab, as I didn't think there was a need for it. 

That was until one day, [Dr Arjen Van 'T Hof](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people) mentioned that he had been looking into 3DP as a method for maximising storage space in the BioBank that the Donnelly lab manages. For some context on this, a typical 10x10 storage box for Eppenddorf boxes are designed designed for 1.5ml tubes. This means that when you have 0.5 ml tubes, although less sample amount is being stored it's consuming more of the physical stoage space. Dr Van 'T Hof had the idea of design custom tube storage boxes that still retained the outer format of the traditional 10x10 boxes, but which had more appropriate dividers to accomodate more of the smaller tubes.
