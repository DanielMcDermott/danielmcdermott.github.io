How useful can 3D printing be in a lab setting? Here's what I've found

Currently writing this blog post, stay tuned.

I first started off with 3D printing (3DP) a few years ago with the Anet A8 (A8). The A8 cheap build-it-yourself type kit, 
which does the job of 3D printing objects, albeit not at the greatest resolution straight out of the box. 

I have spent numerous hours upgrading, tweaking, fixing and generally tinkering with the A8 and now have it in a condition 
where is reliable produces prints analogous to the commercially available and professionally calibrated 3D printers,
specifically, the Original Prusa i3 MK2 which the A8 is a clone of.

The most common question I get when people find out I have a 3D printer is either *how much did it cost?* or *why do you need a
3D printer?*
