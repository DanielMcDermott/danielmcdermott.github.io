My name is Sean Tomlinson. I'm a PhD student reigstered at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and Lancaster University, funded by the MRC on their Doctoral Training Partnership. This site is where I host interactive plots relating to my work to share with colleagues and post information about my work that may be of interest to others.
